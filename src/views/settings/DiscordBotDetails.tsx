1. Add [the Bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=868709691469987860&permissions=361314126849&integration_type=0&scope=bot) to your server

2. Run \`/register Server\` targeting either an individual user or an org contractor. For example, to have orders associated with you as an individual, run \`/register Server User\`. To register on behalf on an org \`/register Server Contractor ORGNAME\`. After doing so, users will automatically be invited to your server when placing an order.

3. Run \`/register Channel\` targeting either an individual user or an org contractor. For example, to have orders associated with you as an individual, run \`/register Channel User\`. To register on behalf on an org \`/register Channel Contractor ORGNAME\`. After doing so, users will automatically be added to threads with the person assigned to their orders.`
